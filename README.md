# Algorithms_Recipe-Management
A group project that I did in my second year at Dundalk Institute of Technology for the bSc in computing course.

# Details
My project partner & I had to create a recipe management application for our algorithms class. The recipes would be arrays, but could <strong>NOT</strong> make use of <strong>ArrayList</strong> objects or any other classes that manipulated arrays. We built systems that employed algorithms for adding to arrays, deleting from arrays and sorting arrays with bubble sort & selection sort.

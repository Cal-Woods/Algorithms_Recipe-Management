# Algorithms_Recipe-Management
A group java project that I did in my second year at Dundalk Institute of Technology for the BSc in computing course.

# Details
My project partner & I had to create a recipe management application for our algorithms class using Java. The recipes would be arrays, but could <strong>NOT</strong> make use of <strong>ArrayList</strong> objects or any other classes that manipulated arrays. We built systems that employed algorithms for adding to arrays, deleting from arrays and sorting arrays with bubble sort & selection sort. Finally, two skeleton classes were given to define a recipe & a recipe book respectively. We filled the classes with algorithm methods. The "Recipe" class had an array for storing ingredients as strings, an integer variable for storing the count of "String" objects in the "ingredients" array, and variables for recipe string "name", string "author", which string "meal" to use the recipe, and a double "rating" for the recipe. The final class was for a "RecipeBook" that held multiple "Recipe" objects in an array of type "Recipe" called "recipes".

# The application
Lastly, an application was built that could make use of the newly created library of methods and allowed the user to add, delete & sort "Recipe" objects in a "RecipeBook" object.
